 This is the 18 November 2003 version of
 DLSODIS: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations
          (Implicit form) with general Sparse Jacobian matrices.

 This version is in double precision.

 DLSODIS solves the initial value problem for linearly implicit
 systems of first order ODEs,
     A(t,y) * dy/dt = g(t,y) ,  where A(t,y) is a square matrix,
 or, in component form,
     ( a   * ( dy / dt ))  + ... +  ( a     * ( dy   / dt ))  =
        i,1      1                     i,NEQ      NEQ

      =   g ( t, y , y ,..., y    )   ( i = 1,...,NEQ )
           i      1   2       NEQ

 If A is singular, this is a differential-algebraic system.

 DLSODIS is a variant version of the DLSODI package, and is intended
 for stiff problems in which the matrix A and the Jacobian matrix
 d(g - A*s)/dy have arbitrary sparse structures.

 Summary of Usage.

 Communication between the user and the DLSODIS package, for normal
 situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
 of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
 details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
 and instructions for special situations.  See also the example
 problem (with program and output) following this summary.

 A. First, provide a subroutine of the form:
                SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
 which computes the residual function
      r = g(t,y)  -  A(t,y) * s ,
 as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
 generated approximation to dy/dt.)  The arrays Y and S are inputs
 to the RES routine and should not be altered.  The residual
 vector is to be stored in the array R.  The argument IRES should be
 ignored for casual use of DLSODIS.  (For uses of IRES, see the
 paragraph on RES in the full description below.)

 B. DLSODIS must deal internally with the matrices A and dr/dy, where
 r is the residual function defined above.  DLSODIS generates a linear
 combination of these two matrices in sparse form.
      The matrix structure is communicated by a method flag, MF:
         MF =  21 or  22     when the user provides the structures of
                             matrix A and dr/dy,
         MF = 121 or 222     when the user does not provide structure
                             information, and
         MF = 321 or 422     when the user provides the structure
                             of matrix A.

 C. You must also provide a subroutine of the form:
                SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
                DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
                INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
 which adds the matrix A = A(t,y) to the contents of the array P.
 NEQ, T, Y, and J are input arguments and should not be altered.
 This routine should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array
 P (of length NEQ).  I.e. add A(i,J) to P(i) for all relevant
 values of i.  The arguments IAN and JAN should be ignored for normal
 situations.  DLSODIS will call the ADDA routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.

 D. For the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
 Jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*s
 (s = a fixed vector) as above.  If dr/dy is being supplied,
 use MF = 21, 121, or 321, and provide a subroutine of the form:
               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
 which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  Here NEQ, T, Y, S,
 and J are input arguments, and the JAC routine is to load the array
 PDJ (of length NEQ) with the J-th column of dr/dy.  I.e. load PDJ(i)
 with dr(i)/dy(J) for all relevant values of i.  The arguments IAN and
 JAN should be ignored for normal situations.  DLSODIS will call the
 JAC routine with J = 1,2,...,NEQ.
      Only nonzero elements need be loaded.  A crude approximation
 to dr/dy, possibly with fewer nonzero elememts, will suffice.
 Note that if A is independent of y (or this dependence
 is weak enough to be ignored) then JAC is to compute dg/dy.
      If it is not feasible to provide a JAC routine, use
 MF = 22, 222, or 422 and DLSODIS will compute an approximate
 Jacobian internally by difference quotients.

 E. Next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
 derivative vector dy/dt.  If the initial value of A(t,y) is
 nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let DLSODIS compute
 this vector (ISTATE = 0).  (DLSODIS will solve the system A*s = g for
 s, with initial values of A and g.)  If A(t,y) is initially
 singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
 you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
 initial values of y and dy/dt.  In that case, use ISTATE = 1 and
 load the initial value of dy/dt into the array YDOTI.
 The input array YDOTI and the initial Y array must be consistent with
 the equations A*dy/dt = g.  This implies that the initial residual
 r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*YDOTI   must be approximately zero.

 F. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODIS once for
 each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
 for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by
 DLSODIS.  On the first call to DLSODIS, supply arguments as follows:
 RES    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
 ADDA   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding A(t,y).
 JAC    = name of user subroutine for Jacobian matrix dr/dy
          (MF = 121).  If not used, pass a dummy name.
 Note: The names for the RES and ADDA routines and (if used) the
        JAC routine must be declared External in the calling program.
 NEQ    = number of scalar equations in the system.
 Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
 YDOTI  = array of length NEQ (containing initial dy/dt if ISTATE = 1).
 T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
 TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
 ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
 RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
 ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
          The estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
          control.  Caution: Actual (global) errors may exceed these
          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
 ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
 ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1 if the
          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
 IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
 RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
             20 + (2 + 1./LENRAT)*NNZ + (11 + 9./LENRAT)*NEQ
          where:
          NNZ    = the number of nonzero elements in the sparse
                   iteration matrix  P = A - con*dr/dy (con = scalar)
                   (If NNZ is unknown, use an estimate of it.)
          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
          In any case, the required size of RWORK cannot generally
          be predicted in advance for any value of MF, and the
          value above is a rough estimate of a crude lower bound.
          Some experimentation with this size may be necessary.
          (When known, the correct required length is an optional
          output, available in IWORK(17).)
 LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
 IWORK  = integer work array of length at least 30.
 LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
 MF     = method flag.  Standard values are:
          121 for a user-supplied sparse Jacobian.
          222 for an internally generated sparse Jacobian.
          For other choices of MF, see the paragraph on MF in
          the full description below.
 Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, YDOTI, RWORK, IWORK,
 and possibly ATOL.

 G. The output from the first call, or any call, is:
      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
 ISTATE =  2  if DLSODIS was successful, negative otherwise.
          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
          -8 means DLSODIS was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
             in casual use, this means A(t,y) is initially singular.
             Supply YDOTI and use ISTATE = 1 on the first call.
          -9 means a fatal error return flag came from sparse solver
             CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS.  Should never happen.

          A return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5, may result from using
          an inappropriate sparsity structure, one that is quite
          different from the initial structure.  Consider calling
          DLSODIS again with ISTATE = 3 to force the structure to be
          reevaluated.  See the full description of ISTATE below.

  If DLSODIS returns ISTATE = -1, -4  or -5, then the output of
  DLSODIS also includes YDOTI = array containing residual vector
  r = g - A * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.

 H. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
 reset TOUT and call DLSODIS again.  No other parameters need be reset.

 Example Problem.

 The following is an example problem, with the coding needed
 for its solution by DLSODIS.  The problem comes from the partial
 differential equation (the Burgers equation)
   du/dt  =  - u * du/dx  +  eta * d**2 u/dx**2,   eta = .05,
 on -1 .le. x .le. 1.  The boundary conditions are periodic:
   u(-1,t) = u(1,t)  and  du/dx(-1,t) = du/dx(1,t)
 The initial profile is a square wave,
   u = 1 in ABS(x) .lt. .5,  u = .5 at ABS(x) = .5,  u = 0 elsewhere.
 The PDE is discretized in x by a simplified Galerkin method,
 using piecewise linear basis functions, on a grid of 40 intervals.
 The result is a system A * dy/dt = g(y), of size NEQ = 40,
 where y(i) is the approximation to u at x = x(i), with
 x(i) = -1 + (i-1)*delx, delx = 2/NEQ = .05.
 The individual equations in the system are (in order):
  (1/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(4/6)dy(1)/dt+(1/6)dy(2)/dt
       = r4d*(y(NEQ)**2-y(2)**2)+eodsq*(y(2)-2*y(1)+y(NEQ))
 for i = 2,3,...,nm1,
  (1/6)dy(i-1)/dt+(4/6)dy(i)/dt+(1/6)dy(i+1)/dt
       = r4d*(y(i-1)**2-y(i+1)**2)+eodsq*(y(i+1)-2*y(i)+y(i-1))
 and finally
  (1/6)dy(nm1)/dt+(4/6)dy(NEQ)/dt+(1/6)dy(1)/dt
       = r4d*(y(nm1)**2-y(1)**2)+eodsq*(y(1)-2*y(NEQ)+y(nm1))
 where r4d = 1/(4*delx), eodsq = eta/delx**2 and nm1 = NEQ-1.
 The following coding solves the problem with MF = 121, with output
 of solution statistics at t = .1, .2, .3, and .4, and of the
 solution vector at t = .4.  Optional outputs (run statistics) are
 also printed.

 Full Description of User Interface to DLSODIS.

 The user interface to DLSODIS consists of the following parts.

 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODIS, which is a driver
      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
      Following these descriptions is a description of
      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).

 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODIS package that may be
      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).

 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
      of the problem and continued solution later.

 4.   Description of two routines in the DLSODIS package, either of
      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
      These relate to the measurement of errors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Part 1.  Call Sequence.

 The call sequence parameters used for input only are
     RES, ADDA, JAC, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK,
     IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
 and those used for both input and output are
     Y, T, ISTATE, YDOTI.
 The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
 optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
 to the return from Subroutine DLSODIS to the user's calling program.)

 The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
 initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
 change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.

 The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.

 RES    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
          the residual vector for the ODE system, defined by
            r = g(t,y) - A(t,y) * s
          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
          s and y (s approximates dy/dt).  This subroutine
          is to have the form
               SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, S, R, IRES)
               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), R(*)
          where NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES are input, and R and
          IRES are output.  Y, S, and R are arrays of length NEQ.
             On input, IRES indicates how DLSODIS will use the
          returned array R, as follows:
             IRES = 1  means that DLSODIS needs the full residual,
                       r = g - A*s, exactly.
             IRES = -1 means that DLSODIS is using R only to compute
                       the Jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
          The RES routine can ignore IRES, or it can omit some terms
          if IRES = -1.  If A does not depend on y, then RES can
          just return R = g when IRES = -1.  If g - A*s contains other
          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
          dropped, if done consistently, when IRES = -1.
             The subroutine should set the flag IRES if it
          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
          Otherwise, it should not reset IRES.  On output,
             IRES = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
          DLSODIS continues integrating the ODE.  Leave IRES
          unchanged from its input value.
             IRES = 2 tells DLSODIS to immediately return control
          to the calling program, with ISTATE = 3.  This lets
          the calling program change parameters of the problem
          if necessary.
             IRES = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
          illegal value of y).  DLSODIS tries to integrate the system
          without getting IRES = 3 from RES.  If it cannot, DLSODIS
          returns with ISTATE = -7 or -1.
             On a return with ISTATE = 3, -1, or -7, the values
          of T and Y returned correspond to the last point reached
          successfully without getting the flag IRES = 2 or 3.
             The flag values IRES = 2 and 3 should not be used to
          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  This is better
          done by calling DLSODIS in a one-step mode and checking the
          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
             If quantities computed in the RES routine are needed
          externally to DLSODIS, an extra call to RES should be made
          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
          To get the current dy/dt for the S argument, use DINTDY.
             RES must be declared External in the calling
          program.  See note below for more about RES.

 ADDA   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds the
          matrix A = A(t,y) to another matrix stored in sparse form.
          This subroutine is to have the form
               SUBROUTINE ADDA (NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, P)
               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), P(*)
               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
          where NEQ, T, Y, J, IAN, JAN, and P  are input.  This routine
          should add the J-th column of matrix A to the array P, of
          length NEQ.  Thus a(i,J) is to be added to P(i) for all
          relevant values of i.  Here T and Y have the same meaning as
          in Subroutine RES, and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).
          IAN and JAN are undefined in calls to ADDA for structure
          determination (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are
          structure descriptors, as defined under optional outputs
          below, and so can be used to determine the relevant row
          indices i, if desired.
               Calls to ADDA are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that
          order.  ADDA must not alter its input arguments.
               ADDA must be declared External in the calling program.
          See note below for more information about ADDA.

 JAC    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
          the Jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g - A*s.  JAC is
          required if MITER = 1, or MOSS = 1 or 3.  Otherwise a dummy
          name can be passed.  This subroutine is to have the form
               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, JAN, PDJ)
               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), S(*), PDJ(*)
               INTEGER IAN(*), JAN(*)
         where NEQ, T, Y, S, J, IAN, and JAN are input.  The
         array PDJ, of length NEQ, is to be loaded with column J
         of the Jacobian on output.  Thus dr(i)/dy(J) is to be
         loaded into PDJ(i) for all relevant values of i.
         Here T, Y, and S have the same meaning as in Subroutine RES,
         and J is a column index (1 to NEQ).  IAN and JAN
         are undefined in calls to JAC for structure determination
         (MOSS .ne. 0).  Otherwise, IAN and JAN are structure
         descriptors, as defined under optional outputs below, and
         so can be used to determine the relevant row indices i, if
         desired.
              JAC need not provide dr/dy exactly.  A crude
         approximation (possibly with greater sparsity) will do.
              In any case, PDJ is preset to zero by the solver,
         so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
         Calls to JAC are made with J = 1,...,NEQ, in that order, and
         each such set of calls is preceded by a call to RES with the
         same arguments NEQ, T, Y, S, and IRES.  Thus to gain some
         efficiency intermediate quantities shared by both calculations
         may be saved in a user Common block by RES and not recomputed
         by JAC, if desired.  JAC must not alter its input arguments.
              JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
              See note below for more about JAC.

    Note on RES, ADDA, and JAC:
          These subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or Y has length
          exceeding NEQ(1).  However, these subroutines should not
          alter NEQ(1), Y(1),...,Y(NEQ) or any other input variables.
          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.

 NEQ    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
          Used only for input.
          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
          these are to be accessed in RES, ADDA, or JAC.

          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
          (The DLSODIS package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
          to RES, ADDA, and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array,
          locations NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data
          and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  Each such subroutine
          must include NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.

 Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
          first call (ISTATE = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
          calls.  On the first call, Y must contain the vector of
          initial values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution
          vector, evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
          for other purposes between calls to the solver.

          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to RES,
          ADDA, and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ,
          and locations Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real
          data and pass it to RES, ADDA, or JAC.  (The DLSODIS
          package accesses only Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). )

 YDOTI  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least NEQ.

          On input:
            If ISTATE = 0 then DLSODIS will compute the initial value
          of dy/dt, if A is nonsingular.  Thus YDOTI will
          serve only as work space and may have any value.
            If ISTATE = 1 then YDOTI must contain the initial value
          of dy/dt.
            If ISTATE = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then YDOTI
          may have any value.
            Note: If the initial value of A is singular, then
          DLSODIS cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
          it must be provided in YDOTI, with ISTATE = 1.

          On output, when DLSODIS terminates abnormally with ISTATE =
          -1, -4, or -5, YDOTI will contain the residual
          r = g(t,y) - A(t,y)*(dy/dt).  If r is large, t is near
          its initial value, and YDOTI is supplied with ISTATE = 1,
          there may have been an incorrect input value of
          YDOTI = dy/dt, or the problem (as given to DLSODIS)
          may not have a solution.

          If desired, the YDOTI array may be used for other
          purposes between calls to the solver.

 T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a
          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached.

 TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
          Used only for input.

          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 0 or 1), TOUT may be
          equal to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next
          call.  For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is
          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.

          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.

          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
          TCUR and HU).

 ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.

 RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
          Input only.

 ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.

             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
          in y, according to an inequality of the form
                      RMS-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
          where       EWT(i) = RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i),
          and the RMS-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
          RMS-norm(v) = SQRT(sum v(i)**2 / NEQ).  Here EWT = (EWT(i))
          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
          the values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).

             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
              4     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)

          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.

          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
          error controls can be obtained by substituting
          user-supplied routines for the setting of EWT and/or for
          the norm calculation.  See Part 4 below.

          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
          down uniformly.

 ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
          2  means take one step only and return.
          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
             beyond t = TOUT and return.
          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).

          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).

 ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
          state of the calculation.

          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
             DLSODIS is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
             (while doing other initializations).  See note below.
          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
             YDOTI (DLSODIS will do other initializations).
             See note below.
          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
             tested for legality.)
          3  means this is not the first call, and the
             calculation is to continue normally, but with
             a change in input parameters other than
             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
             the conditional inputs IA, JA, IC, and JC,
             and any of the optional inputs except H0.
             A call with ISTATE = 3 will cause the sparsity
             structure of the problem to be recomputed.
             (Structure information is reread from IA and JA if
             MOSS = 0, 3, or 4 and from IC and JC if MOSS = 0).
          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
          ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.

          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
           0 or 1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and
              ISTATE = 0 or 1 on input.
           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
           3  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES signalled
              DLSODIS to halt the integration and return (IRES = 2).
              Integration as far as T was achieved with no occurrence
              of IRES = 2, but this flag was set on attempting the
              next step.
          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
              completing the requested task, but the integration
              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
              integration steps.  See written message for details.
              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
              the run to stop.
          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
              one attempted step, before completing the requested
              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
              may be inappropriate.
          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
              one attempted step, before completing the requested
              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix.
          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i) = 0.0)
              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
              the integration was successful as far as T.
          -7  means that the user-supplied Subroutine RES set
              its error flag (IRES = 3) despite repeated tries by
              DLSODIS to avoid that condition.
          -8  means that ISTATE was 0 on input but DLSODIS was unable
              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  See the
              printed message for details.
          -9  means a fatal error return flag came from the sparse
              solver CDRV by way of DPRJIS or DSOLSS (numerical
              factorization or backsolve).  This should never happen.
              The integration was successful as far as T.

          Note: An error return with ISTATE = -1, -4, or -5
          may mean that the sparsity structure of the
          problem has changed significantly since it was last
          determined (or input).  In that case, one can attempt to
          complete the integration by setting ISTATE = 3 on the next
          call, so that a new structure determination is done.

          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
          similarly, ISTATE (= 3) need not be reset if RES told
          DLSODIS to return because the calling program must change
          the parameters of the problem.
          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
          calling the solver again.

 IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
                   Default values will be used in all cases.
          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.

 RWORK  = a work array used for a mixture of real (double precision)
          and integer work space.
          The length of RWORK (in real words) must be at least
             20 + NYH*(MAXORD + 1) + 3*NEQ + LWM    where
          NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
          MAXORD = 12 (if METH = 1) or 5 (if METH = 2) (unless a
                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+9*NEQ)/LENRAT   if MITER = 1,
          LWM = 2*NNZ + 2*NEQ + (NNZ+10*NEQ)/LENRAT  if MITER = 2.
          in the above formulas,
          NNZ    = number of nonzero elements in the iteration matrix
                   P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and J is the
                   Jacobian matrix dr/dy).
          LENRAT = the real to integer wordlength ratio (usually 1 in
                   single precision and 2 in double precision).
          (See the MF description for METH and MITER.)
          Thus if MAXORD has its default value and NEQ is constant,
          the minimum length of RWORK is:
             20 + 16*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 11, 111, 311, 12, 212, 412,
             20 +  9*NEQ + LWM  for MF = 21, 121, 321, 22, 222, 422.
          The above formula for LWM is only a crude lower bound.
          The required length of RWORK cannot be readily predicted
          in general, as it depends on the sparsity structure
          of the problem.  Some experimentation may be necessary.

          The first 20 words of RWORK are reserved for conditional
          and optional inputs and optional outputs.

          The following word in RWORK is a conditional input:
            RWORK(1) = TCRIT = critical value of t which the solver
                       is not to overshoot.  Required if ITASK is
                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (See ITASK.)

 LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
          (This will be checked by the solver.)

 IWORK  = an integer work array.  The length of IWORK must be at least
            32 + 2*NEQ + NZA + NZC   for MOSS = 0,
            30                       for MOSS = 1 or 2,
            31 + NEQ + NZA           for MOSS = 3 or 4.
          (NZA is the number of nonzero elements in matrix A, and
          NZC is the number of nonzero elements in dr/dy.)

          In DLSODIS, IWORK is used for conditional and
          optional inputs and optional outputs.

          The following two blocks of words in IWORK are conditional
          inputs, required if MOSS = 0, 3, or 4, but not otherwise
          (see the description of MF for MOSS).
            IWORK(30+j) = IA(j)     (j=1,...,NEQ+1)
            IWORK(31+NEQ+k) = JA(k) (k=1,...,NZA)
          The two arrays IA and JA describe the sparsity structure
          to be assumed for the matrix A.  JA contains the row
          indices where nonzero elements occur, reading in columnwise
          order, and IA contains the starting locations in JA of the
          descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in that order, with
          IA(1) = 1.  Thus, for each column index j = 1,...,NEQ, the
          values of the row index i in column j where a nonzero
          element may occur are given by
            i = JA(k),  where   IA(j) .le. k .lt. IA(j+1).
          If NZA is the total number of nonzero locations assumed,
          then the length of the JA array is NZA, and IA(NEQ+1) must
          be NZA + 1.  Duplicate entries are not allowed.
          The following additional blocks of words are required
          if MOSS = 0, but not otherwise.  If LC = 31 + NEQ + NZA, then
            IWORK(LC+j) = IC(j)       (j=1,...,NEQ+1), and
            IWORK(LC+NEQ+1+k) = JC(k) (k=1,...,NZC)
          The two arrays IC and JC describe the sparsity
          structure to be assumed for the Jacobian matrix dr/dy.
          They are used in the same manner as the above IA and JA
          arrays.  If NZC is the number of nonzero locations
          assumed, then the length of the JC array is NZC, and
          IC(NEQ+1) must be NZC + 1.  Duplicate entries are not
          allowed.

 LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
          (This will be checked by the solver.)

 Note:  The work arrays must not be altered between calls to DLSODIS
 for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
 optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
 The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
 available for use by the user outside DLSODIS between calls, if
 desired (but not for use by RES, ADDA, or JAC).

 MF     = the method flag.  Used only for input.
          MF has three decimal digits-- MOSS, METH, and MITER.
          For standard options:
             MF = 100*MOSS + 10*METH + MITER.
          MOSS indicates the method to be used to obtain the sparsity
          structure of the Jacobian matrix:
            MOSS = 0 means the user has supplied IA, JA, IC, and JC
                     (see descriptions under IWORK above).
            MOSS = 1 means the user has supplied JAC (see below) and
                     the structure will be obtained from NEQ initial
                     calls to JAC and NEQ initial calls to ADDA.
            MOSS = 2 means the structure will be obtained from NEQ+1
                     initial calls to RES and NEQ initial calls to ADDA
            MOSS = 3 like MOSS = 1, except user has supplied IA and JA.
            MOSS = 4 like MOSS = 2, except user has supplied IA and JA.
          METH indicates the basic linear multistep method:
            METH = 1 means the implicit Adams method.
            METH = 2 means the method based on Backward
                     Differentiation Formulas (BDFs).
              The BDF method is strongly preferred for stiff problems,
            while the Adams method is preferred when the problem is
            not stiff.  If the matrix A(t,y) is nonsingular,
            stiffness here can be taken to mean that of the explicit
            ODE system dy/dt = A-inverse * g.  If A is singular,
            the concept of stiffness is not well defined.
              If you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
            recommend using METH = 2.  If it is stiff, the advantage
            of METH = 2 over METH = 1 will be great, while if it is
            not stiff, the advantage of METH = 1 will be slight.
            If maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
            with METH may be necessary.
          MITER indicates the corrector iteration method:
            MITER = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
                      sparse Jacobian, given by Subroutine JAC.
            MITER = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
                      generated (difference quotient) sparse
                      Jacobian (using NGP extra calls to RES per
                      dr/dy value, where NGP is an optional
                      output described below.)
            If MITER = 1 or MOSS = 1 or 3 the user must supply a
            Subroutine JAC (the name is arbitrary) as described above
            under JAC.  Otherwise, a dummy argument can be used.

          The standard choices for MF are:
            MF = 21 or 22 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and IC/JC
                 supplied,
            MF = 121 for a stiff problem with JAC supplied, but not
                 IA/JA or IC/JC,
            MF = 222 for a stiff problem with neither IA/JA, IC/JC/,
                 nor JAC supplied,
            MF = 321 for a stiff problem with IA/JA and JAC supplied,
                 but not IC/JC,
            MF = 422 for a stiff problem with IA/JA supplied, but not
                 IC/JC or JAC.

          The sparseness structure can be changed during the problem
          by making a call to DLSODIS with ISTATE = 3.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Optional Inputs.

 The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
 call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
 this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
 location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
 The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
 case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
 of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
 Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
 locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
 then set those of interest to nonzero values.

 Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value

 H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
                   The default value is determined by the solver.

 HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
                   The default value is infinite.

 HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)

 MAXORD  IWORK(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  The default
                   value is 12 if METH = 1, and 5 if METH = 2.
                   If MAXORD exceeds the default value, it will
                   be reduced to the default value.
                   If MAXORD is changed during the problem, it may
                   cause the current order to be reduced.

 MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
                   allowed during one call to the solver.
                   The default value is 500.

 MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
                   value.  The default value is 10.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Optional Outputs.

 As optional additional output from DLSODIS, the variables listed
 below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODIS
 which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
 the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
 Except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
 on any successful return from DLSODIS, and on any return with
 ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7.  On a return with -3 (illegal
 input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
 (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
 On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
 as noted below.

 Name    Location      Meaning

 HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).

 HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.

 TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
                   will always be at least as far as the argument
                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).

 TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)

 NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.

 NRE     IWORK(12) the number of residual evaluations (RES calls)
                   for the problem so far, excluding those for
                   structure determination (MOSS = 2 or 4).

 NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (each involving
                   an evaluation of A and dr/dy) for the problem so
                   far, excluding those for structure determination
                   (MOSS = 1 or 3).  This equals the number of calls
                   to ADDA and (if MITER = 1) JAC.

 NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).

 NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.

 IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.

 LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required.
                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
                   input return for insufficient storage.

 LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required.
                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
                   input return for insufficient storage.

 NNZ     IWORK(19) the number of nonzero elements in the iteration
                   matrix  P = A - con*J  (con is a constant and
                   J is the Jacobian matrix dr/dy).

 NGP     IWORK(20) the number of groups of column indices, used in
                   difference quotient Jacobian aproximations if
                   MITER = 2.  This is also the number of extra RES
                   evaluations needed for each Jacobian evaluation.

 NLU     IWORK(21) the number of sparse LU decompositions for the
                   problem so far. (Excludes the LU decomposition
                   necessary when ISTATE = 0.)

 LYH     IWORK(22) the base address in RWORK of the history array YH,
                   described below in this list.

 IPIAN   IWORK(23) the base address of the structure descriptor array
                   IAN, described below in this list.

 IPJAN   IWORK(24) the base address of the structure descriptor array
                   JAN, described below in this list.

 NZL     IWORK(25) the number of nonzero elements in the strict lower
                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
                   iteration.

 NZU     IWORK(26) the number of nonzero elements in the strict upper
                   triangle of the LU factorization used in the chord
                   iteration.  The total number of nonzeros in the
                   factorization is therefore NZL + NZU + NEQ.

 The following four arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
 may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
 For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
 its base address, and its description.
 For YH and ACOR, the base addresses are in RWORK (a real array).
 The integer arrays IAN and JAN are to be obtained by declaring an
 integer array IWK and identifying IWK(1) with RWORK(21), using either
 an equivalence statement or a subroutine call.  Then the base
 addresses IPIAN (of IAN) and IPJAN (of JAN) in IWK are to be obtained
 as optional outputs IWORK(23) and IWORK(24), respectively.
 Thus IAN(1) is IWK(ipian), etc.

 Name    Base Address      Description

 IAN    IPIAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NEQ + 1.
 JAN    IPJAN (in IWK)  structure descriptor array of size NNZ.
         (see above)    IAN and JAN together describe the sparsity
                        structure of the iteration matrix
                          P = A - con*J,  as used by DLSODIS.
                        JAN contains the row indices of the nonzero
                        locations, reading in columnwise order, and
                        IAN contains the starting locations in JAN of
                        the descriptions of columns 1,...,NEQ, in
                        that order, with IAN(1) = 1.  Thus for each
                        j = 1,...,NEQ, the row indices i of the
                        nonzero locations in column j are
                        i = JAN(k),  IAN(j) .le. k .lt. IAN(j+1).
                        Note that IAN(NEQ+1) = NNZ + 1.
 YH      LYH            the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
          (optional     (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
           output)      of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
                        evaluated at t = TCUR.  The base address LYH
                        is another optional output, listed above.

 ACOR     LENRW-NEQ+1   array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
                        represent the estimated local error in y on the
                        last step.  This is the vector E in the
                        description of the error control. It is defined
                        only on a return from DLSODIS with ISTATE = 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.

 The following are optional calls which the user may make to
 gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODIS.
 (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
 SLATEC error handling package.)

     Form of Call                  Function
   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          Set the logical unit number, LUN, for
                             output of messages from DLSODIS, if
                             The default is not desired.
                             The default value of LUN is 6.

   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         Set a flag to control the printing of
                             messages by DLSODIS.
                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
                             This risks losing valuable information.)
                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).

                             Either of the above calls may be made at
                             any time and will take effect immediately.

   CALL DSRCMS(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
                             the internal Common blocks used by
                             DLSODIS (see Part 3 below).
                             RSAV must be a real array of length 224
                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
                             array of length 71 or more.
                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
                                DSRCMS is useful if one is
                             interrupting a run and restarting
                             later, or alternating between two or
                             more problems solved with DLSODIS.

   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        Provide derivatives of y, of various
        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
                             desired.  It may be called only after
                             a successful return from DLSODIS.

 The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
 The form of the call is:

   LYH = IWORK(22)
   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)

 The input parameters are:

 T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODIS).
             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
 K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
             by DLSODIS directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
 LYH       = the base address of the history array YH, obtained
             as an optional output as shown above.
 NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.

 The output parameters are:

 DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
 IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
             On an error return, a message is also written.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Part 3.  Common Blocks.

 If DLSODIS is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
 must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
   (1) the call sequence to DLSODIS, and
   (2) the two internal Common blocks
         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
                      followed by 37 integer words),
         /DLSS01/  of length  40  (6 double precision words
                      followed by 34 integer words).

 If DLSODIS is used on a system in which the contents of internal
 Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
 declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
 that their contents are preserved.

 If the solution of a given problem by DLSODIS is to be interrupted
 and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
 or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
 following the return from the last DLSODIS call prior to the
 interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
 internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
 next DLSODIS call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
 blocks, use Subroutines DSRCMS (see Part 2 above).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.

 Below are descriptions of two routines in the DLSODIS package which
 relate to the measurement of errors.  Either routine can be
 replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
 a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
 done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
 (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
 superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)

 (a) DEWSET.
 The following subroutine is called just before each internal
 integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
 described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
     SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
 where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODIS call sequence,
 YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
 EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.

 If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
 (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
 in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the DVNORM
 routine (see below), and also used by DLSODIS in the computation
 of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
 quotient Jacobians.

 In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
 the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
 are available from the history array YH, described above under
 optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
 extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
 factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
 given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
 NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
 can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
     NQ = ILS(33)
     NST = ILS(34)
     H = RLS(212)
 Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
 YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
 unnecessary when NST = 0).

 (b) DVNORM.
 The following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
 root-mean-square norm of a vector v:
     D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
 where:
   N = the length of the vector,
   V = real array of length N containing the vector,
   W = real array of length N containing weights,
   D = SQRT( (1/N) * sum(V(i)*W(i))**2 ).
 DVNORM is called with N = NEQ and with W(i) = 1.0/EWT(i), where
 EWT is as set by Subroutine DEWSET.

 If the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
 value of DVNORM suitable for use in the error control in DLSODIS.
 None of the arguments should be altered by DVNORM.
 For example, a user-supplied DVNORM routine might:
   -substitute a max-norm of (V(i)*w(I)) for the RMS-norm, or
   -ignore some components of V in the norm, with the effect of
    suppressing the error control on those components of y.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Other routines in the DLSODIS package.

 In addition to Subroutine DLSODIS, the DLSODIS package includes the
 following subroutines and function routines:
  DIPREPI  acts as an interface between DLSODIS and DPREPI, and also
           does adjusting of work space pointers and work arrays.
  DPREPI   is called by DIPREPI to compute sparsity and do sparse
           matrix preprocessing.
  DAINVGS  computes the initial value of the vector
             dy/dt = A-inverse * g
  ADJLR    adjusts the length of required sparse matrix work space.
           It is called by DPREPI.
  CNTNZU   is called by DPREPI and counts the nonzero elements in the
           strict upper triangle of P + P-transpose.
  JGROUP   is called by DPREPI to compute groups of Jacobian column
           indices for use when MITER = 2.
  DINTDY   computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = TOUT.
  DSTODI   is the core integrator, which does one step of the
           integration and the associated error control.
  DCFODE   sets all method coefficients and test constants.
  DPRJIS   computes and preprocesses the Jacobian matrix J = dr/dy
           and the Newton iteration matrix P = A - h*l0*J.
  DSOLSS   manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
  DEWSET   sets the error weight vector EWT before each step.
  DVNORM   computes the weighted RMS-norm of a vector.
  DSRCMS   is a user-callable routine to save and restore
           the contents of the internal Common blocks.
  ODRV     constructs a reordering of the rows and columns of
           a matrix by the minimum degree algorithm.  ODRV is a
           driver routine which calls Subroutines MD, MDI, MDM,
           MDP, MDU, and SRO.  See Ref. 2 for details.  (The ODRV
           module has been modified since Ref. 2, however.)
  CDRV     performs reordering, symbolic factorization, numerical
           factorization, or linear system solution operations,
           depending on a path argument IPATH.  CDRV is a
           driver routine which calls Subroutines NROC, NSFC,
           NNFC, NNSC, and NNTC.  See Ref. 3 for details.
           DLSODIS uses CDRV to solve linear systems in which the
           coefficient matrix is  P = A - con*J, where A is the
           matrix for the linear system A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y),
           con is a scalar, and J is an approximation to
           the Jacobian dr/dy.  Because CDRV deals with rowwise
           sparsity descriptions, CDRV works with P-transpose, not P.
           DLSODIS also uses CDRV to solve the linear system
             A(t,y)*dy/dt = g(t,y)  for dy/dt when ISTATE = 0.
           (For this, CDRV works with A-transpose, not A.)
  DUMACH   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
  XERRWD, XSETUN, XSETF, IXSAV, and IUMACH  handle the printing of all
           error messages and warnings.  XERRWD is machine-dependent.
 Note:  DVNORM, DUMACH, IXSAV, and IUMACH are function routines.
 All the others are subroutines.
